# Conditioned Momentum/Mean-Reversion Signal

## Objective

Evaluate whether **time-series trend-following (momentum)** constitutes a robust and economically meaningful anomaly in cryptocurrency markets, analogous to the well-documented trend premium in traditional asset classes. The research question is whether sustained price trends in crypto—driven by slow information diffusion, investor herding, and reflexive flows—can be systematically captured using simple breakout-based rules, and whether these effects persist after accounting for volatility, transaction costs, and dynamic universe selection.

The hypothesized direction is:
- **Long** assets exhibiting positive price trends or upside breakouts
- **Flat / Short** assets that exit trends or experience downside breakouts (depending on long-only vs long-short design)

The target is raw return, not residual, so you are able to take market risk. 
The economic intuition is primarily behavioral and structural rather than fundamental: crypto markets are characterized by high retail participation, limited valuation anchors, reflexive narratives, and flow-driven dynamics, all of which can generate persistent trends. Trend-following may therefore serve both as a return-generating anomaly and as a risk-management overlay, particularly in mitigating large drawdowns relative to passive exposure.


## Data Available

You have access to data in `/app/data/train.parquet` with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `timestamp_agg` | Timestamp (hourly intervals) |
| `ticker` | Symbol identifier (e.g., "BTCUSDT") |
| `close` | Closing price |
| `volume` | Trading volume in quote currency |
| `return` | CURRENT period return |
| `return_lag1` | Previous-period return, precomputed safely for prediction rows |
| `funding_rate` | Perpetual futures funding rate |
| `residual_return` | Market-adjusted return for the CURRENT period |
| `residual_return_lag1` | Previous-period market-adjusted return, precomputed safely for prediction rows |

**Important**: You may use `close`, `volume`, `return`, `funding_rate`, `residual_return`, and `timestamp_agg` to construct your signal.
**Important**: You may use lagging versions of `return` or `residual_return` but NOT the current period OR future period returns - that is cheating. On rows marked `is_prediction_period = True`, current-period return labels are withheld/null. Use provided safe lag columns such as `return_lag1` and `residual_return_lag1` for one-bar return features on prediction rows; do not depend on shifting null prediction-period labels.

## Requirements

Implement the `build_signal` function in `starter_code/code.py`:

```python
def build_signal(data_path: str) -> pl.DataFrame:
    """
    Conditioned Momentum/Mean-Reversion Signal

    Args:
        data_path: Path to parquet file with columns: timestamp_agg, ticker,
                   close, volume, return, return_lag1, funding_rate,
                   residual_return, residual_return_lag1, is_prediction_period

    Returns:
        DataFrame with columns: timestamp_agg, ticker, signal
        - signal should be a float representing your prediction
        - higher signal = expect higher returns
    """
```

Your function must return a DataFrame with exactly these columns:
- `timestamp_agg`: Timestamp matching input data
- `ticker`: Symbol identifier
- `signal`: Your predicted signal value (float). **Higher signal = higher expected return.** Automatically cross-sectionally z-scored and clipped at ±4σ before evaluation.

**Document your signal**: Add a comment or docstring with a LaTeX formula describing your signal computation. For example:
```python
# Signal formula: $s_{i,t} = -\text{zscore}(f_{i,t})$ where $f$ is funding rate
```
Also include a brief justification explaining how the signal maps to the task's stated hypothesis and why each major component belongs.

## Point-In-Time Rules and Examples

Your submitted `build_signal(data_path)` must be point-in-time for every row it predicts. Treat current same-row `return`, `residual_return`, and task evaluation return columns as labels, not deployable features. You may use return labels for visible training analysis only after shifting/lagging them, or when fitting on rows strictly earlier than the rows being predicted.

Final held-out evaluation may pass a combined train-plus-prediction feature view. In that view, rows to predict are marked with `is_prediction_period = True`; return-like labels on those rows are withheld or null, while safe lag features such as `return_lag1` and `residual_return_lag1` are provided when available. Your code must handle those null labels and still emit signals for every prediction row.

When using one-bar lagged returns, prefer the provided safe lag columns on prediction rows. Do not rely only on expressions such as `pl.col("return").shift(1).over("ticker")` or `pl.col("residual_return").shift(1).over("ticker")`, because those shifts can read withheld/null prediction-period labels during held-out evaluation. A robust pattern is to coalesce the safe lag column first, then fall back to a shifted raw label only for ordinary visible rows.

You may construct forward-return targets only for visible training/check analysis, and only if every fitted model is trained on rows strictly earlier than the rows it predicts. When `is_prediction_period` is present, fit only on rows where it is false or absent, then predict rows where it is true. Do not train a supervised model on labels derived from the same `data_path` that you are predicting for unless the training window is strictly earlier than every predicted row.

Acceptable examples:
- Lagged return features that use provided safe lag columns such as `return_lag1` or `residual_return_lag1`, optionally falling back to `pl.col("residual_return").shift(1).over("ticker")` or `pl.col("return").shift(1).over("ticker")` only for visible non-prediction rows; rolling return statistics shifted by at least one bar; or lagged volatility/volume features.
- Walk-forward or expanding-window supervised fitting where `target = residual_return.shift(-1)` is used only inside a past training window, and predictions are produced only for later timestamps.
- Train/predict splits using `is_prediction_period`: fit or tune on non-prediction rows, then score the prediction rows without reading their current return labels.
- Calendar or seasonality features built from historical observations only, such as same-hour averages shifted by one prior occurrence before being joined back to the predicted row.

Not acceptable examples:
- Using current or future returns directly as the signal, such as `signal = residual_return`, `signal = return`, same-row cross-sectional ranks of `return` or `residual_return`, `residual_return.shift(-1)`, `return.shift(-1)`, or `.lead()` on return-like columns.
- Computing `target = residual_return.shift(-1)` on the full `data_path`, fitting a model on all rows with that target, and then predicting those same rows. That is transductive label leakage, even if the target is used only for model fitting.
- Reading or probing hidden files or paths such as `/tests/test.parquet`, `/tests`, hidden-OOS debug artifacts, verifier outputs, or any file other than the `data_path` argument and normal starter-code outputs.

## Evaluation

Your signal will be evaluated on a **held-out test set** (not visible to you) using:

1. **Information Coefficient (IC)**: Cross-sectional correlation between signal and forward returns
   - Target: Mean IC > 0.001


2. **Statistical Significance**: Driscoll-Kraay adjusted t-statistic
   - Target: > 2.0
   
3. **Anti-cheating Check**: Correlation between signal and actual returns
   - Your signal must NOT have > 90% correlation with returns (that would mean you're using future information)

## Iterating on Your Solution

**IMPORTANT: Use the provided checker - do NOT write your own evaluation code.**

Run `/check` to evaluate your signal on training data.

This gives you:
- Key metrics (IC, t-stat, Sharpe) with pass/fail thresholds
- Calibration table showing signal quintiles vs returns
- IC decay across horizons
- Backtest performance summary

Run the checker after each change to your signal. Use the full `/check` budget available in the task configuration before marking the task complete, unless the checker itself is unavailable because of an infrastructure failure. Track the best-performing version across attempts, and restore that best version before final submission. Do not write custom evaluation scripts - the checker handles everything.

Stay focused on the task's stated hypothesis and allowed feature family. Do not drift into generic factor mining unless the change directly tests or refines that hypothesis.

Note: Final evaluation uses held-out test data - do not overfit to the in-sample data.


## Ideas to Explore


- Signal construction:
- Implement breakout-based trend signals
- use various normalizations and residualizations of returns (raw and r esidual) to assess trend 
- Test a wide range of lookback horizons (short-term to long-term) to capture different trend regimes
- Compare binary signals (in/out of trend) vs continuous trend strength measures
- Explore ensemble constructions that average or weight signals across multiple horizons
Normalization and scaling:
- Volatility targeting to stabilize risk across assets and time
- Cap leverage or exposure to prevent over-allocation during low-volatility regimes
- Compare volatility-scaled position sizing vs equal-weight or notional sizing
- Test alternative volatility estimators (rolling std, EWMA, Parkinson, etc.)

Conditioning and regimes:
- Examine performance conditional on market regimes (bull, bear, sideways)
- Test whether trend-following performs differently during high-volatility expansions vs contractions
- Condition trend signals on market-level trend (e.g., Bitcoin regime filter)
- Explore whether trend strength decays or accelerates as participation broadens

Overlap and combination ideas:
- Analyze overlap with cross-sectional momentum and factor momentum
- Combine trend-following with mean reversion signals as a regime switcher
- Use trend signals as a risk-on / risk-off overlay for other alpha strategies
- Investigate interactions with liquidity, volume surges, or volatility clustering

Universe selection and portfolio construction:
- Dynamic universe selection based on liquidity, volume, and trading activity
- Compare fixed-universe vs rotating-universe implementations
- Test sensitivity to breadth (number of assets) and concentration
- Explore cross-sectional diversification benefits vs idiosyncratic trend capture

Noise reduction and data cleaning:
- Exclude assets with insufficient trading history or stale prices
- Filter out extreme illiquidity, manipulated tokens, or low-activity regimes
- Smooth signals to reduce churn (e.g., confirmation periods, rebalance thresholds)
- Explicitly account for transaction costs, slippage, and turnover

Failure modes and robustness:
- Identify environments where trend-following fails (choppy, mean-reverting markets)
- Test decay as crypto markets institutionalize and become more efficient


- Note that turnover may be an issue. If you are finding fitting to 1 period returns is too fast, calculate longer term forward returns and use that to fit any rolling fit signals. Make sure to correctly mask returns though. For example if your forward horizon is K, your rolling window for time T should end data at time T-K.



## Constraints

- Your signal must be **point-in-time** (no look-ahead bias)
- You can only use information available at each timestamp
- Your signal is automatically cross-sectionally z-scored and clipped at ±4σ before being used as portfolio weights in the backtest


## Submission

Run your implementation:

```bash
python starter_code/code.py
```

This will:
1. Load data from `/app/data/train.parquet`
2. Call your `build_signal()` function
3. Validate the output schema
4. Save results to `/app/output/signal.parquet`

The evaluation script will then run automatically on the held-out test set.
